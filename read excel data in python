xlrd is a library for reading data and formatting information from Excel files, whether they are .xls or .xlsx files.

Installation:
pip install xlrd

This package has been tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+ on Linux, and is also expected to work on Mac OS X and Windows.

from xlrd import open_workbook

book=open_workbook('forum.xlsx')
sheet=book.sheet_by_index(3)

# read header values into the list    
keys=[sheet.cell(0, col_index).value for col_index in xrange(sheet.ncols)]

dict_list=[]
for row_index in xrange(1, sheet.nrows):
    d={keys[col_index]: sheet.cell(row_index, col_index).value
         for col_index in xrange(sheet.ncols)}
    dict_list.append(d)

print dict_list


Create a sheet(forum.xlsx) containing:

A   B   C   D
1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
